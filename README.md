# Rainfall Prediction using 7 Popular Models

This project focuses on predicting rainfall using a combination of classic machine learning algorithms. We explore and compare the performance of **7 popular models** to predict rainfall more accurately based on historical data.

## Overview

Rainfall prediction is critical for agriculture, water resource management, and disaster prevention. Using weather-related features, we train multiple models to predict whether rainfall will occur.  
This notebook covers:

- **Training and evaluating** 7 different machine learning models
- **Model comparison** based on accuracy and other metrics
- **Visualization** of results

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Neural Network (Multilayer Perceptron)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Light GBM
- CatBoost Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Load and explore the rainfall dataset.
2. **Model Training**:
   - Train each model using the training set
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
4. **Comparison**:
   - Compare model results to find the best performer

## Key Results

- Display of performance metrics for each model
- Visual comparison to easily understand effectiveness


## Conclusion

This study shows that ensemble methods like **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **CatBoost** generally outperform simpler models for rainfall prediction tasks.
